Revamp the HOME page with a premium, content-rich layout.

Goal:
Create a professional landing experience including hero banners, featured products, live auctions, categories, trust badges, brand carousel, and editorial sections. Keep AR/EN i18n and RTL.

Scope (frontend only):
1) Hero area
   - Full-width hero carousel (3 slides) with image + heading + subtext + primary/secondary CTAs.
   - Autoplay + swipe on mobile, pause on hover, dots navigation. Images lazy-loaded.

2) Promo banners
   - Three clickable tiles below hero (e.g., “New Arrivals”, “Pre-Owned”, “Live Auctions”) using current brand palette (Gold/Ivory/Charcoal). Each tile links to /new, /used, /auctions.

3) Featured grids
   - Section: “Featured New Perfumes” → 8 items (ProductCard), CTA “View all /new”.
   - Section: “Editor’s Picks (Pre-Owned)” → 8 items, CTA “View all /used”.
   - Pull from a new HomeService (mock) endpoints:
     - getFeaturedNew(), getFeaturedUsed()

4) Live auctions strip
   - Horizontal carousel of AuctionCard (image, current bid, bids_count, countdown).
   - CTA “View all auctions” → /auctions.
   - Data: HomeService.getLiveAuctions()

5) Categories & filters
   - Scrollable chip list of top categories/notes (Oud, Citrus, Amber, …). Chip click → /search?category=…
   - Optional sub-banner per selected chip.

6) Trust & authenticity
   - “Why buy from us” strip with 4 trust badges (Authenticity Verified, Secure Payments, Fast Shipping, Easy Returns), each with icon + short text (i18n).

7) Top brands carousel
   - Logo slider of 8–12 brands; clicking → /search?brand=BrandName.

8) Editorial / Guides (optional content)
   - Two cards: “How to Buy Pre-Owned Safely”, “Guide to Bidding in Auctions”. Link to /help (or placeholder).

9) Newsletter/CTA
   - Email capture box (mock submit) + consent text (i18n). Save to local mock service.

10) Footer quick links
   - Keep existing footer but add quick links row to /new, /used, /auctions.

Implementation details:
- Create: frontend/src/pages/home/HomeSections/* (Hero.tsx, PromoTiles.tsx, FeaturedGrid.tsx, AuctionsStrip.tsx, CategoriesChips.tsx, TrustBadges.tsx, BrandsCarousel.tsx, Editorial.tsx, Newsletter.tsx)
- Service: frontend/src/services/homeService.ts with mocks:
    getHeroSlides(), getFeaturedNew(), getFeaturedUsed(), getLiveAuctions(), getTopBrands(), getCategories()
- Reuse existing ProductCard & Auction countdown component.
- Add skeleton loaders for each section + error states.
- All strings in i18n (en/ar). Apply RTL-safe logical CSS (padding-inline, etc).
- Mobile:
   • 1-column grids, carousels swipeable, sticky bottom CTA not required on home.
- Performance:
   • Lazy-load images, code-split the HomeSections, prefetch hover links.
- SEO:
   • Update <title> and meta description for home via a small SEO component.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Home shows: hero carousel, promo tiles, 2 featured grids, auctions carousel, categories chips, trust badges, brands carousel, editorial cards, newsletter.
- Each CTA navigates client-side to the correct route.
- Countdown visible on auctions and updates live.
- All sections localized (AR/EN) and switch RTL/LTR correctly.
- No horizontal scroll on mobile. Lighthouse ≥ 90 (Perf/Access) on home.

Constraints:
- Do NOT modify API/backend logic; use mock HomeService.
- Keep theme/colors/typography consistent.
- Output minimal: after completion create ONE checkpoint and PRINT CHANGED PATHS ONLY.
