Mobile UI refinement (Header + Product Cards) with Noon-like compact style. Keep outputs minimal and PRINT CHANGED PATHS ONLY.

Scope A) Mobile Header (<= 480px)
- Make a compact sticky header: height 56px, Charcoal bg, subtle shadow.
- Center brand logo; place hamburger on inline-start (LTR=left, RTL=right), language + search icons on inline-end.
- Convert search into full-screen overlay on mobile (opens via icon; closes with X).
- Ensure proper RTL/LTR: use logical props (padding-inline, inset-inline-start, etc.).
- Increase tap targets to >=44px; fix z-index so header stays above drawers/overlays.
- Prevent double headers: Navbar rendered once in Layout only.

Scope B) Product Cards (catalog: /new, /used, /auctions)
- Add a "compact" ProductCard variant for mobile.
- Grid: 2 columns on mobile (≥360px), 3 on md, 4 on lg.
- Card sizing: image aspect-ratio 4:5 (or 1:1 fallback), image height ~160–180px on mobile.
- Reduce paddings/gaps; clamp title to 2 lines; keep brand as small label; price bold & prominent.
- Buttons condensed to icons on mobile (heart, cart/bid) with tooltips on desktop.
- Badges (NEW/USED/AUCTION) smaller (12–13px), corner-rounded.

Scope C) Auction thumbnails & broken images
- Add image fallback (onError) to show a placeholder perfume bottle SVG.
- Add Skeleton placeholders while images load.
- Ensure auction cards use same compact variant; keep countdown visible under image.

Scope D) Footer (mobile)
- Stack columns; reduce padding; ensure <Link to="..."> client-side navigation only.

Scope E) Performance & polish
- Lazy-load catalog images; use loading="lazy".
- Avoid horizontal scroll on mobile except for intended tables.
- Keep palette/typography as is.

Acceptance
- On 360–414px widths: header aligned (centered logo), hamburger + search work, no overlap.
- Catalog shows compact cards (2 per row) with crisp images, no layout shift.
- Auction page shows images reliably (fallback if broken) and compact layout.
- RTL/LTR switches instantly and keeps alignment.
- Create ONE checkpoint and print CHANGED PATHS ONLY.
