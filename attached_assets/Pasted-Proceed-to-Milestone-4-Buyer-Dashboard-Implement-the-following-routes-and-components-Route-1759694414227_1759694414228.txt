Proceed to Milestone 4 — Buyer Dashboard.

Implement the following routes and components:

### Routes
- /account
- /account/orders
- /account/bids
- /account/favorites
- /account/support

### UI & Components
1. **Account Overview (/account)**
   - Show profile summary (name, email, join date)
   - Button: Edit Profile (opens modal or separate page)
   - Display total orders, active bids, and favorite products count.

2. **Orders (/account/orders)**
   - Table listing: Order ID, Product, Date, Amount, Status, and Actions (View, Download Invoice placeholder)
   - Status colors: pending=gold, shipped=blue, completed=green, canceled=red
   - Allow filtering by status.

3. **Bids (/account/bids)**
   - Table of user bids with: Auction, Current Status, Your Max Bid, Result
   - Indicate "Winning" or "Outbid"
   - Option to view auction details (/auction/:id)

4. **Favorites (/account/favorites)**
   - Grid of favorited items using existing ProductCard component
   - Buttons: Remove from favorites / View Details

5. **Support (/account/support)**
   - Ticket list (subject, date, status)
   - Button: “Open New Ticket” → form (subject, message, upload optional)
   - Status colors: open=gold, in progress=blue, closed=gray
   - Support messages can be mocked now (API ready later)

### Data & API
- Use mock services:
  - GET /api/orders/mine
  - GET /api/bids/mine
  - GET /api/favorites
  - GET/POST /api/support/tickets
- Keep using mock data for now; structure the Axios stubs to be easily switchable.

### UX & Theme
- Keep Charcoal/Gold/Ivory theme and Arabic/English support.
- Reuse table and card components for consistency.
- Responsive layout with sidebar navigation for Buyer Dashboard (on mobile → collapsible drawer).

### Acceptance Criteria
- All routes render properly and switch between AR/EN flawlessly.
- Tables and grids display mock data.
- Support ticket creation works (mock POST).
- Design matches brand aesthetics and RTL layout.
- Create checkpoint and print changed paths after completion.
