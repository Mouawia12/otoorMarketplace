Fix auction timers, product routing, and complete the Auction Product Detail requirements.

Scope:

A) Auction list & routing
- In all places listing auctions (/auctions, home, seller/admin lists), ensure each card links correctly:
  - Product detail: <Link to={`/p/${product.id}`}> (for non-auction/overview link)
  - Auction detail: <Link to={`/auction/${auction.id}`}> (explicit auction page)
- On auction cards, display a live "time remaining" countdown computed from end_at (end_at - now). If now > end_at, show "Ended".
- Show bids_count and highest_bid on the card (mock fields allowed until backend is wired).

B) Auction detail page (/auction/:id)
- At top: product title + brand + condition (NEW/USED) + "Auction" badge.
- Left: image gallery (main + thumbnails).
- Right panel includes EXACTLY:
  1) Product details: brand, size_ml, concentration, condition, description.
  2) Seller info: seller display name (and badge if verified_seller).
  3) Time remaining: live countdown from start_at/end_at; if not started show "Starts in", if ended show "Ended".
  4) Bids count: total number of bids.
  5) Highest bid (current_price): SAR formatted.
- Below: bid input with +/- (min_increment), Place Bid button with validation (amount >= current_price + min_increment).
- Bid log table: username (masked), amount, time.
- i18n keys for all labels (ar/en). RTL respected.

C) Product detail page (/p/:id)
- Ensure the route opens correctly from any product/auction card.
- If product has an active auction, display a compact banner with: time remaining, bids_count, highest bid, and a button "Go to auction" → /auction/:id.

D) Countdown implementation
- Create a reusable hook useCountdown({ startAt?: string|number, endAt: string|number }) returning { days, hours, minutes, seconds, status: 'scheduled'|'running'|'ended' }.
- Create <Countdown> component that renders dd:hh:mm:ss and switches label/text per status, updates each 1s with cleanup.

E) Data model (mock ok for now)
- Ensure auction DTO has: { id, product_id, start_at, end_at, min_increment, current_price, bids_count, seller: { id, name, verified_seller }, product: { id, title, brand, size_ml, concentration, condition, description, images[] } }.
- If backend is not ready, adapt the mock service to return these fields and map them in the page/component.

F) Testing
- Verify auction list shows live countdowns.
- Clicking product card opens /p/:id; clicking auction CTA opens /auction/:id.
- On auction page, the five required fields are visible and localized.
- Minimal output only: after completion, create a checkpoint and print CHANGED PATHS ONLY.

Constraints:
- Do not modify unrelated dashboard logic.
- Keep existing theme and i18n.
- Use logical CSS props (padding-inline, margin-inline) to stay RTL-safe.
