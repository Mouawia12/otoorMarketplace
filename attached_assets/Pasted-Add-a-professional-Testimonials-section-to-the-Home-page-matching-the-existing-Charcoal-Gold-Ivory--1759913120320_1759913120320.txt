Add a professional Testimonials section to the Home page, matching the existing Charcoal/Gold/Ivory theme with full AR/EN i18n and RTL support.

Scope:
1) Data (mock, swappable later):
   - Create frontend/src/services/testimonialsService.ts with:
     type Testimonial = { id:number; name:string; avatar?:string; rating:number; text_ar:string; text_en:string; date:string; location_ar?:string; location_en?:string };
     export listTopTestimonials(): Promise<Testimonial[]> returning 6–9 items.

2) Components:
   - Create frontend/src/pages/home/HomeSections/Testimonials.tsx
   - Layout: responsive grid or horizontal carousel on mobile.
   - Card includes: avatar (initials fallback), name, location, star rating (out of 5), review text (clamped to 4 lines), date.
   - Add decorative subtle quotes icon and soft shadow; rounded-12 style to match brand.

3) Styling & UX:
   - Section title: "آراء العملاء" / "What our customers say" with small subtitle.
   - Use brand colors: cards on white, accents in Gold (#C8A24A), headings in Charcoal.
   - Add hover elevation on desktop; swipeable on mobile (CSS scroll-snap).
   - Include an average rating badge (e.g., 4.8 ★ from 1,200+ reviews) at the section header (mock).

4) i18n & RTL:
   - All strings in en/ar locale files (titles, subtitles, labels).
   - When AR is active, text aligns right and carousel scrolls RTL (use logical CSS: padding-inline/margin-inline).

5) Accessibility:
   - aria-labels for rating and review text.
   - High-contrast stars; alt text for avatar.

6) Integration:
   - Import <Testimonials /> into Home page after FeaturedNew and before AuctionsStrip (or appropriate position).
   - Add skeleton loaders and error state.

7) Acceptance:
   - Section renders 6–9 reviews with proper AR/EN text and RTL.
   - Mobile: horizontal swipe (scroll-snap), Desktop: 3-column grid.
   - Average rating badge visible; stars reflect rating.
   - Lighthouse Accessibility ≥ 90 on home.

Constraints:
   - Frontend only; keep output minimal.
   - Print CHANGED PATHS ONLY and create one checkpoint when done.
