## Importance of Proper Storage

Perfumes are sensitive to environmental factors like heat, light, and humidity. Improper storage can alter the fragrance and diminish its quality.

### Best Storage Locations

1. **Closed Cabinet**: Away from light and heat
2. **Bedroom**: Moderate and stable temperature
3. **Storage Box**: Extra protection from light

### Avoid These Places

- Bathroom (high humidity)
- Window sill (direct sunlight)
- Car (fluctuating temperatures)

## Signs of Perfume Deterioration

Watch for these indicators of declining perfume quality:

1. **Color Change**: Liquid has darkened
2. **Different Scent**: Sour or strongly alcoholic
3. **Changed Texture**: Became sticky or cloudy

## Daily Usage Tips

### Proper Spraying Technique

- Spray on pulse points (wrist, behind ears, neck)
- Don't rub the perfume after spraying
- Spray from 15-20 cm distance

### Right Amount

- 2-3 sprays for concentrated perfumes (Parfum)
- 4-5 sprays for lighter fragrances (EDT)
- One spray on clothes (test first!)

## Extending Perfume Life

1. **Close Bottle Immediately**: Prevent alcohol evaporation
2. **Avoid Excess Air**: Don't leave cap open
3. **Use Regularly**: Perfumes are for wearing, not displaying
4. **Keep Original Box**: Extra protection when not in use

## When to Replace Your Perfume?

Most perfumes last 3-5 years when stored properly:

- **Citrus fragrances**: 1-2 years
- **Floral scents**: 3-4 years
- **Woody and Oriental**: 5+ years

Remember: Your perfume is a precious investment, take care of it!
